        <p>A mortgage loan is a loan used to purchase a property, where the property itself serves as collateral. To calculate the maximum available mortgage loan amount for a borrower, several rules determined by the Bank of Latvia and the Consumer Rights Protection Centre of Latvia are followed. These rules are designed to ensure responsible lending and borrowing, and to protect borrowers from taking on excessive debt.</p>
        <p>This site is used to calculate the maximum mortgage loan amount you can afford based on your net income, existing loans, and other factors.</p>
        <h3>Calculation Rules</h3>
        <p>To calculate the max available mortgage loan amount for a borrower, several rules determined by the Bank of Latvia borrower-based macroprudential measures and The Consumer Rights Protection Centre of Latvia are followed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Borrower-based macroprudential measures aim to decrease the probability of the borrower taking on an excessive debt burden and being unable to make payments on loans, as well as to reduce the borrower's losses if the borrower still becomes insolvent.</li>
            <li>These measures affect lending standards and the range of potential borrowers, contributing to responsible lending and borrowing throughout the whole financial cycle.</li>
            <li>They increase the resilience of borrowers and lenders to economic shocks, providing long-term financial stability gains by limiting the formation of imbalances, improving loan portfolio quality, decreasing losses in case of a crisis, and reducing the negative impact on consumption and the economy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Several borrower-based measures are established in Latvia:</h4>
